# GithubRepository
This is my Final Project for a c++ OOP course
this is an attempt to code a class database manipulation, it basically reads a database txt file, goes through the data and give the user the ability to modify on the data by adding, removing or modifying on the courses and the students; at the end the program ends with changes being saved back to the database file.
It's not the best code out there, but hopefully enough to get me started!
