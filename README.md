# GithubRepository
This is my Final Project for my C++ OOP course
this is an attempt to code a class database manipulation program; it basically loads a database txt file, goes through the data, parses it properly, displays it adequently then gives the user the ability to modify on the data by adding, removing or modifying the courses and the students; at the end the program ends with changes being saved back to the database file.
It's not the best code out there, but hopefully enough to get me started!
